}
```

## 🔧 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Parameters |
|--------|----------|-------------|------------|
| GET | `/api/lost-found` | Get all items with filters | search, category, status, dateRange, page, limit |
| POST | `/api/lost-found` | Create new lost/found item | itemName, category, description, location, date, contact, status, images |
| GET | `/api/lost-found/:id` | Get specific item | id |
| PUT | `/api/lost-found/:id` | Update item (mark as resolved) | isResolved, resolvedAt |
| DELETE | `/api/lost-found/:id` | Delete item | id |

## 📊 Sample Data

The system includes 10 sample Lost & Found items:

### By Status:
- **Lost Items**: 4
- **Found Items**: 6

### By Category:
- **Electronics**: 3 items (iPhone, MacBook, AirPods)
- **Accessories**: 2 items (Wallet, Backpack)
- **Keys**: 1 item (Car keys)
- **Books**: 1 item (Chemistry textbook)
- **Clothing**: 1 item (Denim jacket)
- **Documents**: 1 item (Student ID)
- **Sports**: 1 item (Tennis racket)

## 🌐 Access Information

**Lost & Found Page**: `http://localhost:3000/lost-found.html`

**API Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/lost-found`

## 🧪 Testing Commands

### Database Operations:
```bash
# Seed Lost & Found data
npm run seed:lostfound

# Seed all data (complaints + lost & found)
npm run seed:all

# View Lost & Found items in MongoDB
mongosh campus_hub --eval "db.lostfounditems.find().pretty()"

# Count items
mongosh campus_hub --eval "db.lostfounditems.countDocuments()"
```

### API Testing:
```bash
# Get all items
curl http://localhost:3000/api/lost-found

# Get items with filters
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/lost-found?status=lost&category=electronics"

# Get statistics
curl http://localhost:3000/api/lost-found/stats
```

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. **User Submission**: Form → API Client → API → MongoDB
2. **Data Retrieval**: MongoDB → API → API Client → Frontend
3. **Search/Filter**: Frontend → API (with query params) → MongoDB → Results
4. **Real-time Updates**: Automatic refresh after submissions

## 🎯 Key Improvements Over localStorage

1. **Persistent Storage**: Data survives browser sessions and computer restarts
2. **Scalability**: Can handle thousands of items efficiently
3. **Search Performance**: Database indexing for fast text search
4. **Data Integrity**: Validation at database level
5. **Concurrent Access**: Multiple users can access simultaneously
6. **Backup & Recovery**: Professional database backup capabilities

## 🎉 Integration Complete!

The Lost & Found system is now fully integrated with MongoDB and ready for production use. All data is properly stored, validated, and accessible through both the web interface and API endpoints.

**Next Steps:**
1. Test the web interface at `http://localhost:3000/lost-found.html`
2. Submit new items to verify they're stored in MongoDB
3. Use search and filter features to test API integration
4. Monitor MongoDB Compass to see real-time data changes
